# CSC5601 - Theory of Machine Learning
## Overview

This repository contains my work from the **CSC5601 - Theory of Machine Learning** class at the Milwaukee School of Engineering (Fall 2025), instructed by Dr. John Bukowy. 
The course focuses on ...

## Learning Objectives

The following course objectives were provided by the course syllabus:

- Explain and analyze machine learning models and prediction algorithms (e.g., k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, SVMs, decision trees)
- Have confidence in applying, manipulating, and interpreting linear algebra and calculus concepts within the context of machine learning
- Implement and validate code for a mathematical model or algorithm given as an equation
- Explain the geometric and algebraic interpretations of linear and non-linear decision boundaries and their relationship to error metrics (e.g., accuracy)
- Understand the concepts of learning theory, i.e., what is learnable, bias, variance, overfitting, curse of dimensionality, splitting data for evaluation of model predictions
- Estimate and plot decision boundaries described by trained models
- Derive, visualize, apply, and interpret loss functions and associated derivatives to assess the quality of model predictions and fit to data
- Describe and implement model training in terms of naïve and gradient-driven search problems over parameter space
- Compare and contrast technical requirements and computational efficiency of two unconstrained optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient descent, Newton’s method)
